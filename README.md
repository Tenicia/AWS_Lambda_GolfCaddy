# My Golf Caddy

## Steps

These are the steps I followed when working on this function:

1. Setting up Alexa (intent/ utterances)
2. Followed steps on [codementor](https://www.codementor.io/blondiebytes/how-to-create-a-voice-interface-for-an-alexa-skill-oxpjxrl76)

## Note worthy comments

  * Create an Amazon account. You need to enter credit card details, but you can make use of the free tier if you put in as region 'us-east-1' in AWS-console.
  * Test the Lambda function in AWS first and use the log file to see if it 'really' works don't rely solely on 'succeeded'.
  * You can also use the Lambda function in Lex.

PS I wanted to implement it in ReactJS desktop app, but that doesn't work. It should be possible in React native.
